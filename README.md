### Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Interactions note:

    the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
    links hover/active: #FF6565
    button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
    max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
